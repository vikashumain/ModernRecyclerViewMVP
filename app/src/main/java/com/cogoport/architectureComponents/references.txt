Android architecture component is also a part of Android jetpack library.
Android architecture components are:-
1.Data binding
2.Lifecycle Aware Components
3.LiveData
4.Navigation
5.Paging
6.ViewModel
7.WorkManager
8.Room

1. Lifecycle Aware Components
a) it contains LifecycleOwner-example:-Activity/Fragment

b) here we have a class called LifeCycle which have event and name as its enumerators
now
each event has its own state
event           state
onCreate()      state is CREATED
onStart()       STARTED
onPause()       PAUSED
onResume()      RESUME
onDestroy()     DESTROY
onStop()        STOP

c) It contains LifecycleObserver also which keeps tracks of all the lifecycler activities in app.it performs actions
which depends on lifecyclerowner.

2.ViewModel (R.drawable.viewmodel)
what does ViewModel does?
a) Display UI Data-ex:- Persits data in it till activity is not destroyed
b) Reacts to user actions
c) Handles OS Communication
d) Load data from Network/Db

Now doing all things in one class or activity is painfully so ViewModel reduces this workload.ViewModel
performs all the logical operations and provides the data to the UI.
so ViewModel survives configuration changes ex:-screen rotation.
ViewModel is not same as onSaveInstanceState() because in onSaveInstanceState() we can only persists
small types of data ex:-Boolean,string,Double, but ViewModel is used for large data such as bitmap,userlists etc.
ViewModel stores and manages UI related data,It Destroyed only if the owner activity is completely
destroyed,uses for communication between UI and DB.
